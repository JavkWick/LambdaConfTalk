## Objective of this talk

- Walk through my development journey on my project.
- Why I chose F# for building tools for Fogent Roleplay and convince you to try it!
- How building with a functional first language taught me how to "Think Functionally".
- How "Thinking Functionally" bled back into the rules of my game creating a far better game.

## The birth of Fogent Roleplay Prt 1

<div class="container">
  <span class="text" markdown="1">
    <ul>
      <li>Lots of D&D during lock down</li>
      <li>Started building my own worlds</li>
      <li>D&D was to constraining</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Not "open source"</li>
        <li>Class based (i.e. you have to be a wizards, rogue, etc... what if I wanna be a blacksmith)</li>
        <li>Rules are fairly coupled with the setting</li>
        <li>Lot's of complexity, hard to teach new players</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

## Functional Thinking Prt 1
- Modeling the domain of Fallen in F# poked holes in my rules
![](./githubAnalyticsForFogentRoleplayCommits.png)
- Pause programming I went straight to the rules and spent probably a ~1-2 months working directly on the rules.

----

## Functional Thinking Prt 2
- Focused on composing existing rules instead of writing brand new ones.
- Examples:
  - Combat spells composed from weapon classes.
  - Magic Spells composed from skill and challenge level rules.
  - Attack ranges, AOEs, magic resource, etc... composed from dice pool size rules


----

## Functional Thinking Prt 3
- Writing my rules (in english) with this funcional mindset shrunk my rules, dramatically improved clarity, and enabled my system be the narrative engine for any story or setting.

- Hence, Fogent Roleplay was created, in honor of F# and Cogent Roleplay!

## Near-term Development
<!-- 
- Finish refactoring character sheet logic (very close).
- Doing some actually UI styling work, defently make a better logo!
- Migrating my current data to a PostgresSQL DB.
- Hosting the website. -->
show more code

----

## Long-term Development

<!-- - Mobile app
- User added content
- Built in rule book
- More settings! -->

## Take aways

- Try F#, it's amazing that for a relatively smaller user base, it swings way above it's weight class.
- Thinking functionally doesn't just apply to programming. It's a mindset and tool that can be applied in far more places than you may have initially considered.
- Finding any way to combine one of your passions with your programming is life changing. As programmers we tend to solve other's problems, solve one of your own for a change.
